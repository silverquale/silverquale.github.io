Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This site exists to record interesting things, useful resources, and thoughts that grab my attention. I love learning more about the world and sharing insights that make it a more tractable and engaging place to live.

I take after R. A. Heinlein’s admonition that “specialization is for insects.” Everything in the universe is woven of the same cloth, so I believe that it’s impossible to understand even its narrowest slices without knowledge of the whole. Alas, the world is so vast and complex that there’s no hope of getting to the bottom of everything! The more I learn, the more I realize how difficult it is for any one person to perceive the whole picture.

I try to approach the world with a mindset of empiricism and intellectual humility. I am always eager to learn from unexpected sources and consider new points of view, although I’ve learned to cultivate a healthy inclination toward skepticism. I believe staunchly in the openness of information, the freedom of thought, and the freedom of conscience. 

My essays here are likely to discuss science, history, and the nature of knowledge itself (e.g., how do we make more accurate predictions?). But I’m also excited to share what I find fun! My interests include music and sound design, cooking, movies and filmmaking, crafting, speculative fiction, and paths toward simple living.
